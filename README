Project Resistance is intended to be a fully transparent view into the process of 
conceiving, developing and selling an application for the iPhone and iPod Touch.
The idea here is that anyone will be able to look at how sausage gets made.

It is essentially a port of the project with the same name hosted on Codeplex
at http://resistance.codeplex.com/.
